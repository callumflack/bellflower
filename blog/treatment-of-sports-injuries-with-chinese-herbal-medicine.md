Did you know that there is a fully-developed area of practice within the broad platform of Chinese medicine, specifically dedicated to the treatment of sports injuries? Originating out of the need to treat battlefield and martial arts-related injuries, Chinese medicine practitioners became specialised in addressing a multitude of injuries at all stages of their manifestation.

In modern practice this area is called Chinese Medical Orthopaedics – and practitioners use a wide variety of methods to hasten recovery and reduce pain. Depending on the actual injury, as well as whether it is in the acute, post-acute or chronic stage, the following modalities can bring about fantastic results: acupuncture, moxibustion, soft-tissue massage, gua sha and herbal liniments and poultices externally as well as herbal medicine internally. 

The injuries that are commonly and easily treatable using these methods include strains, sprains, bruises – and recovery times of fractures and dislocations can even be hastened! 

The Chinese medicine approach has a lot to say about injury prevention as well. If you live an active lifestyle, having an excellent diet and regular acupuncture are two things you can do that will help. Specific foods to include and avoid in your diet can be discussed in your treatment.

So next time you or a family-member or friend are injured, give some thought to Chinese medicine as an effective way to get back on track quicker. I welcome any inquiries you might have.

All the best,
