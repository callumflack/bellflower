One vital thing that influences your health is your diet. This is not new information, but what it actually means and how to decide what to eat differs depending on who you talk to. It is hard to know which perspective to adhere to when working out what you want to eat in order to look after yourself.

The Chinese medical perspective assigns qualities to all food types, based on their thermal properties as well as their flavour. Foods of differing thermal natures will influence the yin and yang, qi and blood in the body according to Chinese medicine thinking. Foods of differing flavour will influence the functioning of specific organs. These principles are also used in herbal medicine. In fact, there is much cross-over between Chinese herbs and Chinese nutritional therapy, to the extent that Chinese herbs are often integrated in cooking to make use of their medicinal properties.

Added to this, how you eat should be reflective of the time of year, and should (ideally) reflect what is seasonally and locally available. This is quite a Taoist way of thinking - and is a way of remaining in harmony with your environment by adapting to seasonal and geographical influences.

During the cold and wet winter months, we can think about what foods and cooking methods can bolster us to remain strong, with healthy immune systems and good energy levels. Chinese nutritional therapy would suggest that good foods to eat at this time would have qi, blood and yang boosting properties. These types of foods keep us warm and nourished. A good example would be lamb, for the meat-eaters among us. Foods might also be naturally sweet in flavour and include such groups as root vegetables - sweet potato, beetroot - as well as sweet corn and pumpkin. These foods support the Spleen organ and enhance our ability to create energy from our dietary intake.
The other aspect to consider is the choice of cooking method. Eating raw, cold and uncooked food might be more appropriate (depending on circumstances) in the warmer months. In winter, slow-cooked and oven-roasted methods are fantastic. These types of cooking draw out the properties of each ingredient and are really warming and easy to digest. Plus they taste delicious! Wonderful and nourishing on a cold winter's day.
A great example is the classic Lamb and root vegetable stew. Here is the recipe I use:

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
* 8 x 200g trimmed lamb forequarter chops</li>
* 1 x large brown onion, diced</li>
* 1 x knob of ginger finely sliced</li>
* 2 x large carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
* 850g butternut pumpkin, peeled and chopped</li>
* 1 x sweet potato, peeled and chopped</li>
* 1/3 cup gluten-free flour</li>
* 4 x tablespoons gluten-free worcestershire sauce</li>
* 4 x dried bay leaves</li>
* 2 vegie stock cubes</li>
* several cups of water</li>
* salt and pepper</li>

### Method
Preheat oven to 160 degrees (140 degrees fan-forced).
Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan on medium to high heat.
Cook chops in batches until browned on both sides.
Transfer chops to a roasting pan.

Add onion and ginger to the frying pan, fry on high until onion is softened. 
Add carrot, pumpkin and sweet potato.
Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.
Stir in flour.
Add stock, worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, salt and pepper.
Cover with water, up to the top of the vegetables.
Bring to boil and then spoon over chops.
Cover tightly with foil.

Bake for 3 hours or until chops are tender.
Remove from oven, and increase heat to 180 degrees (200 degrees fan-forced).
Mash pumpkin using a fork to thicken stew.
Season with salt and pepper.
Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
Discard chop bones and bay leaves.

Enjoy! All the best for winter,<br>
