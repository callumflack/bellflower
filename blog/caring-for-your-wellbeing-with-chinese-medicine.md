We often think of going to see the acupuncturist when we have something that's wrong. We might have an injury, or pain, or perhaps a problem sleeping, or with stress. While these are all great reasons to book in for some treatment, there is another way that acupuncture (and Chinese herbal medicine) can help you.
In times gone by in China, patients would often STOP going to their acupuncturist when they became ill. That seems the wrong way round, right? Why would they do this? Because people would get acupuncture and take herbs to stay healthy!

The thing is that thanks to the Chinese medical diagnostic process, a practitioner is able to pick up imbalances in your health at a very subtle level. This enables them to help you well before a small problem becomes a big one. Even while you may feel healthy, with regular acupuncture you can improve on this even more. Doing things to stay healthy - in the main - means the avoidance of illness. It's simple when you think about it, but what it really means is an active engagement in preventative and proactive healthcare, rather than it being reactive.

Many patients of mine will come to the clinic for a particular issue or condition that they need help addressing - and once this is resolved, continue to come for treatments, perhaps once every 4-6 weeks. This becomes maintenance or wellness treatment, where we work together to maintain their health. We are then able to deal with any little problems before they have a chance to develop into something worse. This treatment often fits into a larger wellness plan that I help people with to maintain their health and quality of life.
