A large number of the people I treat in the clinic suffer from poor sleep. It is a serious problem that can significantly impact on our stress levels, energy levels and quality of life. Some people have difficulty falling asleep, some wake through the night while others wake early and can't fall back to sleep. Some people have vivid and frightening dreams. Many have busy minds that just can't switch off. The net result for many people is that they are missing out on the rest and rejuvenation that occurs with deep sleep. It is an unfortunate reality that many people do their best to manage, sometimes well and sometimes not as well.

The good news is that for a lot of people there are great things you can do to restore good sleep and break the cycle of insomnia and the tiredness and stress that comes with it. 'Sleep Hygiene' is a term used to define a list of things you can do and things to avoid to get you in the best state for a full night's rest.

It must be said that these things are not set in stone, what works for some won't for others. You can perhaps look at them as a rough guide and adopt what you find is helpful to you.

### What to do:

* Some gentle exercise after finishing your working day, to mark a clean end to the day and start to the evening.</li>
* Eat dinner early. Have a good 1-2 hours to digest your food before going to bed.</li>
* Practice yoga, meditation or relaxation exercises of your choice.</li>
* Have a bath, with candles and relaxing scented oils.</li>
* Establish regular sleep patterns. Rising and going to bed at similar times day-in day-out can program your body to prepare for sleep.</li>

### What not to do:

* Drink caffeine after midday.</li>
* Eat your evening meal right before bed.</li>
* Use PC's, TV's, tablets and smartphones in bed.</li>
* Watch stimulating shows on the TV, such as action shows.</li>
* Engage in conflict with your partner or a family member (if you can!).</li>
* Drink too much alcohol. Try periods without it to assess its role in your sleep.</li>

Having a course of acupuncture and Chinese herbs can work wonders to get you back on track with your sleep! Please get in touch if you'd like to know more or schedule an appointment.
