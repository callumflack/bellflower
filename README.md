The site design is an exercise in clean, legible typography with a reductive, high-contrast color palette. The aim is for a quick understanding, with clear calls-to-action that speak for themselves, never hurried.

I've used Rem as my scale unit site-wide (type & structure) but with a great dependency on adapting measures according to media queries, it has become clear that   scaling typography and interface linearly doesn't work, nor is it even a good shortcut. I won't be using Rem in this way again.

Built using [Harp](http://harpjs.com), Jade, with stylesheet philosophy borrowed from the exemplar [SuitCSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit).
