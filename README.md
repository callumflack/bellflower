BELLFLOWER

This is a responsive blog/marketing site for Bellflower Chinese Medicine, built using the awesome & too-easy-not-to-start Harp, hosted on Heroku.

In this site I've experimented with Harp, Jade, SuitCSS and I've waxed on, waxed off my sass starter files. I've tried to implement new css styles in terms of components and utilities: a work in progress.

I've used Rem as my scale unit through-out the site (type & structure), but with a great dependency on adapting measures according to media queries, I've had to override many font-sizes in pixels to manage it, and that flag became too obvious too late.
