Bellflower
=========================================

A responsive blog/marketing site for Bellflower Chinese Medicine. Built using [Harp](http://harpjs.com), hosted on Heroku.

In this site I've experimented with Harp, Jade, the exemplar SuitCSS and I've done alot of work on my sass library as a set of bases, components and utilities: a work in progress.

I've used Rem as my scale unit through-out the site (type & structure), but with a great dependency on adapting measures according to media queries, I've had to override many font-sizes in pixels to manage it, which became too obvious too late. I can't find a reason to use Rem any more.

The site design is an exercise in clean, legible typography with a reductive, high-contrast color palette. The aim is for a quick understanding, with clear calls-to-action that speak for themselves, never hurried.
